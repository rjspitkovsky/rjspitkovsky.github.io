<p>I graduated George Washington University, '13, with a degree in political science. Four years of work in the legal field have led to their natural conclusion: I have decided to abandon that path in favor of one that has excited me for years(programming). I'm now attending Flatiron School and am excited to share my thoughts as they occur on this (school-mandated) blog! </p>
