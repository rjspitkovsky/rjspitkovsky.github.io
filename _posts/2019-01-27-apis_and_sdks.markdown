Two of the central tools that I work with on a daily basis (and make the world go round) are APIs and SDKs. These are acronyms that you may see all the time and not fully understand what they do and why they are used. To promote my own understanding as well as others, I'm going to go over these tools right now. 

## API 
API stands for Application Programming Interface and they are the way our applications communicate with each other. A very standard form of API communication is in JSON notation -- you send a JSON of information to an API endpoint and then await a response. You can write code to handle that response and keep in mind that that response may an error message so you should code an error handler as well. There are so many different ways different systems can communicate so the use of APIs is a major component of how the web works. For me, APIs are how we communicate with our customers, and it helps us do so in an extremely quick and efficient way. We have different APIs that are used in specific circumstances -- they help us quickly understand what the customer is trying to communicate and guides our swift response. 

## SDK
SDK stands for Software Development Kit. Imagine your project as one house in a housing development. The APIs are the phone lines, and the wifi and all the different communication methods that go from inside your house to outside. The furniture and the art and all the things that make a house personal is your code. But if you want all the houses that share your software to work the same they should have the same physical features and design. SDKs are the physical structure, the skeleton of the house. You download an SDK and you have the foundation that you can build on and add your own personal code to. The SDK may include APIs that will help with communicating with other applications. We have SDKs in a variety of languages, like C#, Java, PHP, and with more in the works. That means that companies that want to do business with us can have a larger option of what language to work with us in -- like choosing between which style of house you'd like. Our SDK makes setting our customers code to communicate with our own an easy process, which is what the SDKs job is. Rather than making other developers write out the entirety of your code, an SDK gives access to the code that should be standardized and speed up integration efforts. 

APIs and SDKs are major components of how the web works and how programs interact and integrate with each other. I work with them on a daily basis and they truly make life easier, especially when handling multiple different integrations simultaneously. I'd definitely recommend reading more on these topics as understanding the communications between code can be a very valuable asset to have.
