Let me start by thanking those of you reading this: You have successfully scrolled back all the way to my very first blog post on my journey to become a computer programmer. Or web developer. Or software engineer. Is it problematic that I am still unsure exactly what I want my future title to be? 

The *suggested* prompt for this post is to discuss what excites me about programming. Why did I decide to leave whatever I was doing in my previous life to go to the FlatIron School and pursue this dream with all the seriousness of a no-nonsense sheriff, two days from retirement? There are two main reasons: 

1. I've always been interested in coding because I viewed it as the future. The greatest advancements in the past few generations seem to come directly from coders innovating and using technology to make our lives easier. I can see an apartment in Kiev on GoogleMaps, or get a ride via Uber (or Lyft; I'm open for sponsorship), or ask a question to an AI that lives in my phone and get an immediate answer. It's incredible. And as time marches on, a new generation of programmers will be creating something even more epic and gamechanging. I'd like to do that. Obviously, there are so many developers who have more modest responsibilities and live normal, unassuming lives, but the dream of being part of a wave of great, positive change is a compelling one. Obviously, I have no idea what that change will look like but I do believe programmers have and will continue to play a crucial role in our society. 

2. On a more micro level, I think I possess the characteristics that make a good coder. I am eager to learn why things work. Fixing error messages to create great code makes me happy. I love that code is always evolving and creative minds play a role in coming up with new solutions--I have always seen myself as a hopeless creative and now I have a new outlet. I don't get discouraged easily. Logic has always been my bag, baby. And I like a good(no, great) challenge. 

TL;DR, I find coding fascinating and crucial to society's development. I also think I am the right temperament to be a part of that innovation. 

I can't wait to scroll back down here in a couple of years, think about what I am doing, and compare it to what I think about the industry at this moment in time. I'll probably have a good laugh at the idealist I am being now. But as I start this journey I have hope and a good feeling that this is exactly where I am supposed to be and that I am doing what I'm supposed to be doing. 

Incidentally, the Flatiron School has been awesome. I am sure I'll talk about that in future posts. Keep coming back for my continuing inner monologue as I go from a glory boy working in the legal field to a gritty computer programmer...
