There is a good reason why I haven't posted on this blog for so long, I swear. It turns out that through some grit, determination, persistance, and a lot of luck, I was able to land my first job in my tech career! The last few months, I've been focusing on orienting myself to my new company, and new position and as a result I've let my blog posts slip through the cracks a little bit. This post is my way of saying: I'm back!!! 

First, a little review: I am currently working on the Integrations team at Riskified, the world's leading eCommerce fraud solution. Besides the culture being great and working with an extremely supportive team, the position is one that exposes me to so many new languages, frameworks, and concepts of software engineering; I feel like I learn something new everyday. It is really rewarding to have that in a job. I know that I'm in a place where my skills as a developer and as someone who can thrive in a business and tech setting can really take off. That is my primary goal of 2019 -- take advantage of my current opportunity to significantly improve my skills and my knowledge base. The fact that I ended 2018 by completing the Flatiron School, and then subsequently found a position that checked every box I was looking for, makes me very pleased. It also makes me very optimstic and driven moving forward through the new year. 

Now, how do I continue moving myself forward in the new year. One of the ways is this blog. Periodically posting on the new things I encounter will not only help me synthesize the new things I'm seeing but it could help connect me to those that work with the same concepts. It may also be a guide to other prospective programmers who are getting exposed to the same technical concepts for the first time that I am. Obviously, I won't be giving up the details of what I work on, but I already have topics that I've touched on at work that would make good posts when I dive into them. 

Other ways to improve myself in 2019 include working on my own independent projects. Having a deeper understanding on the development side will be critical to keeping my skills sharp and deepen my knowledge base. It's also fun! Going to networking events and being an active part of the tech community of New York will be another way to expose myself to likeminded individuals in the industry --  someone who wants to learn must take every chance they get to do so! I'd love to go to at least one networking event a month. 

Obviously my primary way to grow my skillset will be to work hard at Riskified and contribute to a great team. I'm so excited to do so. The other steps on top of that are just extra curricular activities to help understand on a deeper level what I work with, and connect to those who work with it too. All together, I expect 2019 to be a year full of challenges (if this were easy, everyone would do it) but considering how far I've come, and how I feel so far at this job, I am confident that I'll take the challenge head on and really grow into my new career throughout the year. I'll be back soon with a new post!
