Any discussion on my progress through the Flatiron curriculum must include the fact that I am working through it at home. This is definitely a huge challenge for me as I have never been a Productive Peter when working at home through grade school and college. There are so many distractions and I am eager to take advantage of a momentary loss of focus and run with it until my day is wasted. So many projects or papers of mine started the night before the due date. 

Obviously, that kind of attitude is not going to work while I go through the curriculum. First of all, cramming is not a great way to learn material (thank you science for proving that). Secondly, the only person who is going to be affected by that method of studying is myself and it's only going to hurt me. I knew that I needed to be self-disciplined to make my way through this course. In fact, I was as much (or more) concerned with my ability to stay disciplined as with the curriculum itself. 

I'm still extremely early on in my journey, but so far, not bad. I expect to have many more observations on working from home and will write about them in the future. For now, take a look at this <ul> called 

 Some Things I've Noticed While Trying to Stay Disciplined Working At Home (working title) 
 
* To thyne own self; be tru -- Bill Shakespeare said that and he was right. I am not a morning person. I've tried to be. But I'm just not. I wake up at the crack of dawn, drink some tea, have some breakfast, do a push-up and get to work. And after about an hour I am ready to slink back to bed and take a nap. I adamently refuse to because then I'll feel like I lost all the momentum from waking up early but then I go through the curriculum dazed and confused (so I'll need to go back and review it again when I am fresh and awake). So instead I wake up when I wake up and get to work with a clear, focused head. Do my early nights get sacrificed by my later starts? Sure, but that's ok. I don't have a tiring commute to deal with anyway(because I work from home, get it? get it?). 

*  Use music to get your juices flowing-- I gotta say, I think I've really broken new ground with this one. Putting music on while you code just really works for me. Some days I have a long mix that's many many hours (like Thomas Jack's 5.5 hour groove cruise). Some days I am on my Pandora (or Spotify; I'm open for sponsorship) radio grooving out. When I am feeling especially wild, I'll hop onto YouTube and pick and choose exactly what song I want. Sure, I have to break every 5 minutes or so to change tracks but when you're in the mood for a specific song you have to do what you have to do. All I'm saying is, having music accompany me and pump me up to code is a big help. 

*  Don't get too high or too low-- I have been super pissed at myself after a day when I wasn't as productive as I wanted to be. I have been angry about not being able to solve a challenging lab and losing the day. We all know that staring at an error message is the trick: if you can handle it and thrive, you're in good shape, and if you crumble then you're an Oreo. The disgusting peanut butter stuffing kind. I have been thrilled when I finally solve a lab or when I have a day that clicks and am able to get more done then I anticipated. Every day is different and I have no idea what type of day it will be when it starts (today was a good day). The point is that a bad day can always be followed with a good one and vice versa; self-discipline means coming to work with a focused mind, unencumbered with the past day's events. 

I have definitely been more disciplined while coding from home than I've ever been in my life. But I also know I can get much better. And I expect to do so. I am on a long journey, learning new things every single day.  It is fun, but it isn't easy.
